# Wallpaper-O-Matic 

> I just wanted a way to collect pictures from my favorite subreddits and then set them as my desktop wallpaper. 

## How To:
- cd into root/app
- run 'python dlwp.py' to download pictures
- Follow the prompts.
- run 'python cwp.py' to randomly select a downloaded picture to set as background

## Future Ideas:
- Subreddits get their own downloads folder.
- Building off the former, I'd like to have a prompt that'll ask me what subfolder I'm in the mood for.
- Maybe even combine subfolders for specific wallpaper categories, for example "VAPORWAVE" and "CYBERPUNK" for "AESTHETICS"
- One main python file combining both interfaces.
